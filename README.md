# Dog Breed Classifier
This program uses Python to determine if submitted images are of dogs or something else, and if they are dogs, it tries to identify their breed.
It measures how accurate each method (ALEXNET, RESNET, VGG) is and how long it takes to classify each image.

### Principal Program Objectives
1. Determine whether each image depicts a dog or not, even if the breed classification is incorrect.
2. Classify the breed accurately for images that are identified as dogs.
3. Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of CNN model architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) in achieving objectives 1 and 2.
4. Assess the computational time required to achieve objectives 1 and 2 with each algorithm, considering whether an alternative approach could yield sufficiently accurate
   results within a reasonable timeframe.

### Alternative Applications (based upon code modifications)
1. Online Pet Registration Systems: Beyond dog shows, similar systems can be implemented for pet registration in cities or communities, ensuring only valid pets are registered.
2. Lost and Found Pet Services: An image classifier can help verify whether a found animal matches a lost pet report, aiding in reunification efforts.
3. Animal Shelters and Adoption Centers: Image classifiers can assist with identifying dog breeds accurately, which aids in matching pets with suitable homes.
4. Vet Clinics and Pet Care Services: Image classifiers can automate identification of animal species and conditions from images, improving efficiency in healthcare for pets.
5. Wildlife Conservation: Adapted classifiers can be used to monitor and track wildlife populations based on camera trap images, aiding conservation efforts.
6. Livestock Monitoring: For agriculture, classifiers can help distinguish between different types of livestock or detect health issues based on visual cues.
