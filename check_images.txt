4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four 
uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The answers from questions 1-3 don't provide sufficient information to make such a decision given that they all classifed the 
uploaded images correctly. However, I would select ALEXNET as the model architechture as the best on uploaded image classification because
it had the fastest runtime of 0:0:0, whereas RESNET had a runtime of 0:0:1 and VGG had a runtime of 0:0:6.
